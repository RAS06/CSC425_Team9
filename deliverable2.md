## Target User Group

Gig Economy Drivers (Ride-Share & Delivery Workers)
Independent contractors working for companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash, often relying on driving as their primary or supplemental income.

## Problem Description

Gig economy drivers face income instability, safety risks, and lack of benefits because they are classified as independent contractors rather than employees. This status means they often lack health insurance, paid time off, or legal protections, even while working long hours.

## Evidence of the Problem

“If I get sick, I just don’t make money. There’s no backup — I have to work, no matter what.” — Ride-share driver interview (2025).

A Pew Research Center survey (2024) found that 60% of gig drivers reported difficulty covering basic expenses due to unpredictable pay.

According to the Economic Policy Institute (2023), gig workers earn about 58% less per hour than traditional employees after accounting for expenses like gas, insurance, and vehicle maintenance.

## “How Might We” Statement

How might we create greater financial stability and safety protections for gig drivers while preserving the flexibility that draws them to the work?
